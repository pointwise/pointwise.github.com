{"tagline":"Macros and Templates for CFD Meshing","google":"","body":"### Welcome to the Pointwise Script Exchange\r\nGlyph, the Tcl-based scripting language in Pointwise and Gridgen, offers the ability to automate all or part of the CFD meshing process.\r\n\r\n- Create macros that automate tedious tasks.\r\n- Write a template to produce geometry or generate an entire mesh.\r\n- Build libraries of custom tools.\r\n- Just have fun making the software do something it wasn't designed to do.\r\n\r\n### Available Glyph Scripts\r\nBelow are links to all available Glyph scripts. If you are a GitHub user, subscribe to your favorite scripts to receive updates on development progress or new version information. Fork scripts and modify the code to create new projects. Who knows, we may merge your changes back into our master branch. Enjoy!\r\n\r\n|Script Name|Description|\r\n|:---------:|:---------:|\r\n|[AirfoilGenerator][]|Generate NACA 4-series airfoil geometries|\r\n|[AirfoilMesh][]|Generate airfoil geometries and boundary layer meshes|\r\n|[ArrayCopyRotate][]|Copy, rotate, and paste entities a prescribed number of times|\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nWe welcome new script authors and contributors! Either submit a new script or fork an existing project on GitHub.
